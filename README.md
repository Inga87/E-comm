*Feedback from reviewer:* 

*"What went well: all research and data processing, goods categorisation, customer segmentation. Powerpoint presentation is ideal. You can automate building cahrts, comment on the process and correctly describe results and draw interesting conclusions.*

*What could have been done better: think of different ways of categorisation, change hypothesis presentation as a table list rather than text*

*It was a pleasure to review your project, thank you!*
